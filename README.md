# Background-Color-Generator

This background color changing app was short and sweet to complete. Since I was given the HTML and CSS assets, all I had to do was create an array of different colors and then add a â€˜click' event listener to the button. Once the button was clicked, a different background color would appear.

## About:

- In this repo I have created a button which is used for changing the background color.

- A very basic webpage just for fun :)

- This can only generate some random 15- 20 colors not all the colors.

- This project is similar to its first part. The only difference is that it will show the hexa code of the background color whenever we change the background.
